## Project Experience

**1.** **Offerme Technology - Study Abroad Information App - Software Developer   2020.01 - 2020.09**

* **Introduction**

  This is a WeChat mini-app that provides information for those undergraduate students who want to study abroad. The main features include "consultation integration", "AI school selection", and "practical tools". We use Mpvue and Java Spring Boot to build the front and back ends, use the restful specification to design the interface. The "AI school selection" feature is based on neural network, and realizes the communication between the service and the application through RPC.

* **Main Work**

  * **Web Crawler design**: Build web crawler based on Python Scrapy to collect training data from internet. 
  * **AI School Selection**:  Build an AI school recommendation model using TensorFlow based on comprehensive evaluation model and Siamese Network. The model is to match students with a similar background and recommend potential universities.
  * **Backend development**: Realizes the communication between the AI school selection service (Python) and the application (Java) through GRPC
  * **Deployment**: Config the server and database, and deploy APP.  

* **Outputs**

  * **Web Crawler**: https://gitee.com/CSPIS/Spiders
  * **Backend Code**: https://gitee.com/CSPIS/SGG
  * **AI School selection**：https://github.com/zmddzf/Recommender

**2. Chongqing University - National Key R&D Project - Research Assistant              2019.06 - 2020.04**

* **Introduction**

  This project comes from a sub-project of the National key R&R Project. Use text clustering methods and topic model to analysis the key ability of service providers in technology consulting service platform.

* **Main Work**

  * **Data Collection**: Use Python selenium to develop web crawler, collecting customers' comments and providers' interview texts.
  * **Data Pre-processing**: Use Python Pandas, Jieba to pre-processing text data.
  * **Topic Mining**: Use LDA model to extract topic from texts, and identify the providers' ability dimensions by analysing the different topic.
  * **Identify Key Ability**: Based on Best-Worst methods，prioritize the ability dimensions.

* **Outputs**

  * **Paper**: Finish《Service Providers' Competence Identification in Knowledge-Intensive Crowdsourcing Context》and《Identifying and Prioritizing Competency Factors for Platforms Managing Service Providers in Knowledge-intensive Crowdsourcing Context》

**3. Thesis - Research on Users’ Questions Matching in Financial Q&A System       2019.12 - 2020.06**

* **Introduction**

  Synonymous questions matching is a basic problem in Q&A system. This research aims to build a neural network that can judge whether the questions asked by users have the same meaning, so as to provide basic support for the construction of financial question-and-answer systems.

* **Main Work**

  * **Model Comparison**: Review different text matching models and compare with each others.
  * **Changing Model**: Make some changes to improve the performance of Siamese network in text matching.
  
* **Outputs**

  * **Interactive Attention**: Proposed a similarity-matrix-based interactive attention mechanism to represent texts more efficiently.
  * **Performance Improvement**: The LSTM Matching model with double interactive attention performs better than ESIM in two Chinese Financial Q&A dataset (balanced and unbalanced).

## Honours
* **2017 China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling** - Second-class Prize in Chongqing
* **2017 Chongqing Open Data Application** - top10 Excellent Creative Design Award
